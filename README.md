# Output-Validation
This Python script is a desktop application built using Tkinter and the Smartsheet API. Its purpose is to allow users to input (or scan) a "Lot Number", validate whether that number already exists in a specified Smartsheet column, and if it doesn't, add it to the top of the sheet.
